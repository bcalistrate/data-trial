# Clever Data Engineer Trial Project

## Goal of the Project:

At Clever, we are turning data into personalized and localized content so our readers can make well-informed decisions about any step of their real estate journey.

Please fork this repository and let us know when you've completed the project with a link to your fork.

Using the data set decribed below, and the Airflow-based data pipeline docker configuration, perform basic analysis for the chosen in `company_profiles_google_maps.csv`. There are basic errors on the DAG that you will need to fix for the pipeline to work properly. 

## Expectations
To perform this project you will need to:
* Perform transforms on the raw data and load them into a PostgreSQL database
* Be able to join datasets together in way for an analyst to be able to rank by a certain set of criteria (you can determine this criteria)
* Be able to filter the data by city or state so analysis can be performed by locality
* Given a locality, create a ranked list according to the criteria youâ€™ve chosen

**Bonus:**
* Interesting additional analysis based on the underlying data
* An example could be Review Sentiment, common themes among ratings, complaints, etc.

## Dataset
Moving company data set (files can be found at [data_exemples](dags/scripts/data_examples) folder)
* fmcsa_companies.csv
* fmcsa_company_snapshot.csv
* fmcsa_complaints.csv
* fmcsa_safer_data.csv
* company_profiles_google_maps.csv
* customer_reviews_google.csv


## Getting started
To get started with Airflow check the [getting started](docs/getting_started.md) documentation.


# Solution Structure

## Overview
This pipeline automates the process of extracting, transforming, and loading data from various datasets into PostgreSQL. It also includes a sentiment analysis on Google Maps reviews. The pipeline uses three schemas to organize the data:

- Public Schema: stores raw data extracted from CSV files.
- Staging Schema: holds intermediate transformed data.
- Analytics Schema: contains final, aggregated tables for use in analysis.

## Pipeline Structure
1. Schema Creation:
   - Ensures the necessary schemas (`staging`, `analytics`) are created before data loading begins.

2. Extraction: 
   - Raw CSV files are loaded into a PostgreSQL database in the `public` schema.

3. Transformation and Aggregation: 
   - Data from the `public` schema is cleaned and transformed, then stored in the `staging` schema.
   - Aggregations and joins are also performed in this stage.

4. Final Transformation: 
   - Final tables are created in the analytics schema, offering a clean, structured dataset for analysts.
   
5. Sentiment Analysis: 
   - A sentiment analysis is performed on the Google Maps reviews (`google_maps_companies_reviews`) using basic NLP techniques, enriching the data with insights into customer feedback, enriching the data with insights.

## Data Analysis
The data exploration and analysis were performed in the [Query Data Notebook](notebooks/query_postgres_data.ipynb). This includes queries on transformed data, ranking companies, filtering by locality, and evaluating review sentiment.

## Improvements
There are opportunities for improvements for this project, such as:
- Use dbt for data transformation, testing and documentation, , enabling more structured and modular transformations.
- Integrate more sophisticated NLP models for sentiment analysis, such as BERT or GPT-based models, to improve accuracy and depth of analysis.
- Split the current monolithic DAG into smaller, more manageable DAGs to improve performance and make the pipeline more maintainable.
